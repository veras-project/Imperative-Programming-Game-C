# Imperative Programming Game in C

A simple game developed in C using the **raylib** library for our Imperative Programming course.


## About The Project

This project is a practical exercise in applying imperative programming principles to build a game from scratch. Our main objectives are to:

* Gain hands-on experience with the C programming language.
* Learn the fundamentals of 2D game development using the **raylib** library.
* Develop skills in collaborative coding, including version control, project planning, and documentation.

### Built With

* C
* raylib
