# Imperative Programming Game in C

A simple game developed in C using the **raylib** library for our Imperative Programming course.


## About The Project

This project is a practical exercise in applying imperative programming principles to build a game from scratch. Our main objectives are to:

* Gain hands-on experience with the C programming language.
* Learn the fundamentals of 2D game development using the **raylib** library.
* Develop skills in collaborative coding, including version control, project planning, and documentation.

### Built With

* C
* raylib

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have the **raylib** library installed. You can find the official installation instructions on their website:
* [https://www.raylib.com/](https://www.raylib.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** 
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/veras-project/Imperative-Programming-Game-C.git](https://github.com/veras-project/Imperative-Programming-Game-C.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project folder:**
    ```sh
    cd Imperative-Programming-Game-C
    ```
3.  **Compile the source code.** 
    ```sh
    gcc main.c -o game -lraylib -lGL -lm -lpthread -ldl -lrt -lX11
    ```
4.  **Run the executable:**
    ```sh
    ./game
    ```

## Project Roadmap

Our development is planned in milestones:

*  **Milestone 1: UI Foundation**
    * Implement the main game menu.
    * Create the credits screen.
*  **Milestone 2: Gameplay Mechanics**
    * *(Next steps will be defined here)*
